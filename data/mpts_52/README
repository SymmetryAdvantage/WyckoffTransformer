MPTS-52 is challenging extension of MP-20, consisting of 40,476 structures up to 52 atoms per cell, sorted
according to the earliest published year in literature. It has less structures than MP-20, becuase structures
where the year of publication is not known are excluded. This dataset, and, especially, the split are not
particularly well-suited for de novo generations, we adopted it mostly for the sake of convinience
of not having to download and preselect the data from the Materials Project.
