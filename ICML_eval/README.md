Notebooks used for ICML 2025 submission, and then some more. Not intended to be modified further, but to be used as a reference.
1. Table 1 is a combintation of the results from [`DFT_eval.ipynb`](DFT_eval.ipynb) and [`MP_20_paper_eval.ipynb`](MP_20_paper_eval.ipynb).
2. Figure 2 (space group distribution): [`space_group_plot.ipynb`](space_group_plot.ipynb)
Bonus:
 - `carbon_24`: we used CHGNet relaxation at the ambient conditions, while the original data was at 10 GPa. The results are in a clear mismatch.
