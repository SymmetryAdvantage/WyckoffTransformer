Configuration is split into three sections:
- `model` - configuation of things such as the embedding sizes and numbers of layers. The configuration can be used for any dataset with the same fields
- `tokenisation` - data into tokens and back
- `optimisation` - configuration of the optimisation process, such as the learning rate and batch size
