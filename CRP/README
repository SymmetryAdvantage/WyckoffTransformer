Scripts to launch WyFormer training and WanDB sweeps at [Constructur Research Platform](https://constructor.tech/products/research-platform). Since nodes can't accept parameters, each requires a separate script, to be generated by `make_training_script.py`.

Note that on CRP the available CPU count doesn't match the visible CPU count. You should set the number of threads and jobs as appropriate. For example, `python scripts/train.py --torch-num-thread ${ROLOS_AVAILABLE_CPU%.*}`
